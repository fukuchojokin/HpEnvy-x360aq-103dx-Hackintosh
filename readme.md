### OpenCore (OC) folder used for my HP Envy x360-aq103dx hackintosh 

- Everything except bluetooth is wokring, among the things I've noticed, haven't troubleshooted it since I haven't had to use bluetooth on it.
- Followed the [dortania guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide).

- Audio is working fine along with audio port using layout id 21.
- Speakers were working but audio port wasn't working with layout id 3 and 15.
