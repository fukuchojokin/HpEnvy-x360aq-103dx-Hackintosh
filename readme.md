### HP Envy x360-aq103dx hackintosh using OpenCore
- Followed this [dortania guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide).
- Everything except bluetooth is working, among the things I've noticed, haven't troubleshooted it since I haven't had to use bluetooth on it.
- Audio is working fine along with audio port using layout id 21.
- Speakers were working but audio port wasn't working with layout id 3 and 15.
